### What Do You Need to Start?

Here’s a quick overview of what you need to begin using NextCaptcha for solving reCAPTCHA in Selenium:

1. **Register an Account**: Visit the [NextCaptcha](https://nextcaptcha.com) website and create an account.
2. **Get the API Key**: Once registered, you’ll receive an API key that will be used to communicate with the NextCaptcha API.
3. **Make a Solve reCAPTCHA Task Payload**: You’ll need to send a payload to the NextCaptcha API that includes details about the reCAPTCHA you want to solve (e.g., site key and page URL).
4. **Send the Request and Get the Result**: Once the payload is sent, NextCaptcha will return the captcha solution, which can be used to pass the challenge in your Selenium test script.

### How to Run?

1. **Setup Your Selenium Environment**:
   - Install Selenium in your preferred programming language (e.g., Python, Java).
   - Set up a WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) for your browser of choice.

2. **Integrate NextCaptcha with Your Selenium Script**:
   - Use Selenium to navigate to the page with the reCAPTCHA challenge.
   - Extract the reCAPTCHA **site key** and **page URL**.
   - Send this data to the NextCaptcha API and retrieve the solution token.
   - Inject the solution token into the reCAPTCHA response field using Selenium and submit the form.

Here’s a simple Python example:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
import requests

# Your NextCaptcha API key
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Selenium setup
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get('https://www.example.com')

# Get reCAPTCHA site key and URL
site_key = 'SITE_KEY_HERE'
url = driver.current_url

# Prepare the payload
payload = {
    "clientKey":"api key",
    "task": {
        "type":"RecaptchaV2TaskProxyless",
        "websiteURL":"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo",
        "websiteKey":"6Le-wvkSAAAAAPBMRTvw0Q4Muexq9bi0DJwx_mJ-"
    }
}

# Send the request to NextCaptcha API
response = requests.post('https://api.nextcaptcha.com/getTaskResult', data=payload)
captcha_result = response.json()['solution']['gRecaptchaResponse']

# Inject the solution into the reCAPTCHA field
driver.execute_script(f"document.getElementById('g-recaptcha-response').innerHTML = '{captcha_result}';")

# Submit the form
driver.find_element_by_id('submit').click()
```
